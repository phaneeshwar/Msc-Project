# Thermal Imaging Monitoring System Using Simple Kriging and Generative Adversarial Networks

# Simple- Kriging
Kriging is a method of spatial interpolation, which is
frequently used in mining, soil and environmental science.
This technique is one of the best approaches to estimate the
unsampled points in the given region of interest of a spatial
field, by utilizing discrete values obtained from different
locations of the workspace and determine the correlation
between the sample points in the region of interest.
